My name is Arthur 👋
 
I love building products that maximise impact 🗺💡⚙️ 🚀 

Why? Because choosing a career might be the most important ethical decision of my life.
> From adulthood, you’ll spend almost half your waking hours on your career. You have about 80,000 hours in your career: 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year, for 40 years. If you can increase the positive impact of those hours just a little, it will probably have a bigger impact than changes to any other parts of your life.

### Currently

I'm a product manager at [cLabs](https://clabs.co/) and spend most days improving [identity](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/identity) primitives for the [Celo](https://celo.org/) blockchain (🌌). If you're interested in this area, pop around our [Discord](https://discord.gg/mD7gKGDuQT) channel.

I'm also a board member on the advisor board of [Kontrol](https://www.kontrol.tech/), a software start-up that works on [formal verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification) of autonomous systems in drones and cars.

### Previously

I developed quantitative approaches to early-stage investing (👨‍💻) and worked on the investment team at [Atrum](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atrumglobal/about/), a private investment office in London (🇬🇧), which specialises in venture and growth equity investments.
