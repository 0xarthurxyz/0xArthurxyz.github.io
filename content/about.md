Hi, I'm [Arthur](https://twitter.com/Arthur__Gousset) 👋 I love building products that maximise impact 🗺💡⚙️ 🚀

Why? Because choosing a career might be the most important ethical decision of my life.

According to [80,000 Hours](https://80000hours.org/make-a-difference-with-your-career/): 
> From adulthood, you’ll spend almost half your waking hours on your career.

> You have about 80,000 hours in your career: 40 hours per week, 50 weeks per year, for 40 years.

> If you can increase the positive impact of those hours just a little, it will probably have a bigger impact than changes to any other parts of your life.

### Currently

I'm a crypto product manager at [cLabs](https://clabs.co/) (🧑‍🚀) working on [identity](https://docs.celo.org/celo-codebase/protocol/identity) for the [Celo](https://celo.org/) blockchain 🌌

I'm also a board member on the advisor board of [Kontrol](https://www.kontrol.tech/), a software start-up that works on [formal verification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_verification) of autonomous systems (💭) in drones and cars.

### Previously

I developed quantitative approaches to early-stage investing (👨‍💻) and worked on the investment team at [Atrum](https://www.linkedin.com/company/atrumglobal/about/), a private investment office in London (🇬🇧), which specialises in venture and growth equity investments.

I have a background in computer science and economics, and spent some time studying at ETH Zurich, Birkbeck College, and the University of Bristol.
