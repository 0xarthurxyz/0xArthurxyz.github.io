## PM ratings

Interesting template from Shreyas on evaluating yourself as a PM:

{{< tweet 1434168984786538500 >}}

Template in text version below👇

**Insight**:

* How well do you **understand** your `product`, `users`, `customers`, and `domain`?

* How well do you **translate** this understanding into compelling `strategy` and product `proposals`?

* How well do you **translate** them into `goals`, `priorities`, and `plans` to stir action?

**Execution**:

* How well did you **deliver** on your `highest priority goals` (i.e. your P0 goals) for the evaluation period?

* How well did you **communicate** and **collaborate** with your `team members`, cross-functional `partners`, and `other teams`?

* How **consistently** does the overall `quality` of product features shipped by your team meet the company’s bar?

**Impact**:

* What is your business **impact**, as seen via the `leading indicators`?
(e.g., beta adoption, customer satisfaction, key ships, feature usage growth, user experience metrics, etc.)

* What is your business **impact**, as seen via the `lagging indicators`?
(e.g., revenue, user growth, margin, cost savings, customer upsell, large customer deployments, etc.)

* How did you **make** your team, org, or the company `better`?

## HiPPos and Problem Statements

From "[My product management toolkit (4) — Problem statements](https://maa1.medium.com/my-product-management-toolkit-4-problem-statements-27e7ebe8804d)".

_What's a problem statement?_

A problem statement is a **formula** used to focus on the key **problems** to be solved. Importantly, problem statements don't include a **solution**.

_What's the formula?_

1. **Stakeholder** (describe person using empathetic language)
2. `NEEDS A WAY TO` **Need** (this is a verb)
3. `BECAUSE` **Insight** (describe what you’ve learned about the stakeholder and their needs).

Here's an example:

_Richard, who loves to eat biscuits wants to find a way to eat at 5 biscuits a day without gaining weight as he’s currently struggling to keep his weight under control._

_What's a HiPPo?_
> HiPPo stands for the “highest paid person’s opinion”, who based on their experience or status knows exactly what needs to happen and why. --- [MAA1](https://maa1.medium.com/my-product-management-toolkit-4-problem-statements-27e7ebe8804d)

> Before you start thinking about solutions, please spend a good amount of time understanding the problem that you’re looking to solve. Please, please don’t be intimidated by ‘HiPPo stakeholders’ who already know the solution and tell you to ‘just to make things happen.’ --- [MAA1](https://maa1.medium.com/my-product-management-toolkit-4-problem-statements-27e7ebe8804d)

## Community-driven Analytics

_What's [Flipside Crypto](https://www.flipsidecrypto.com/)?_

Flipside crypto is a website that 

> puts pre-modeled and labeled blockchain data in the hands of communities. Through dashboard and visualization tools, as well as auto-generated API endpoints, data analysts can easily create queries that answer any question.

_Who does [Flipside Crypto](https://www.flipsidecrypto.com/) work with?_

> Flipside works directly with leading crypto projects to reward on-demand analytics through structured bounty programs.
> Questions sourced directly from the community provide insight into what communities care about as well as analytics needed to drive ecosystem engagement and growth.

(💡) This is similar to [Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz/home), which is a website where you can create and publish crypto dashboards using blockchain data (e.g. [ENS](https://dune.xyz/makoto/-eth-registration-funnel)).

_Why does this matter?_

The Terra ecosystem is crowdsourcing data analytics using Flipside Crypto.

_How do they do this?_

If I understand correctly, they [delegated](https://www.notion.so/teamflipside/Flipside-Bounties-for-Terra-77f67a879b124a72a984a236b0428620) 500k LUNA to Flipside crypto to run a validator node on the Terra network. They yield generated from this validator node is used to pay bounties to users that submit dashboards that answer custom analystics questions.
