_Also PM ratings, HiPPos, and community-driven analytics._

## PM ratings

Interesting template from Shreyas on evaluating yourself as a PM:

{{< tweet 1434168984786538500 >}}

Template in text version below👇

**Insight**:

* How well do you **understand** your `product`, `users`, `customers`, and `domain`?

* How well do you **translate** this understanding into compelling `strategy` and product `proposals`?

* How well do you **translate** them into `goals`, `priorities`, and `plans` to stir action?

**Execution**:

* How well did you **deliver** on your `highest priority goals` (i.e. your P0 goals) for the evaluation period?

* How well did you **communicate** and **collaborate** with your `team members`, cross-functional `partners`, and `other teams`?

* How **consistently** does the overall `quality` of product features shipped by your team meet the company’s bar?

**Impact**:

* What is your business **impact**, as seen via the `leading indicators`?
(e.g., beta adoption, customer satisfaction, key ships, feature usage growth, user experience metrics, etc.)

* What is your business **impact**, as seen via the `lagging indicators`?
(e.g., revenue, user growth, margin, cost savings, customer upsell, large customer deployments, etc.)

* How did you **make** your team, org, or the company `better`?

## Community-driven Analytics

_What's [Flipside Crypto](https://www.flipsidecrypto.com/)?_

1. Bounties for dashboards that answer questions from "financiers"

2. pre-labelled data and SQL execution environment for "analysts"

_Side note: This is similar to [Dune Analytics](https://dune.xyz/home), where you can create and publish dashboards using blockchain data (e.g. [ENS](https://dune.xyz/makoto/-eth-registration-funnel))_.

The Terra ecosystem is crowdsourcing data analytics using Flipside Crypto. If I understand correctly, they [delegated](https://www.notion.so/teamflipside/Flipside-Bounties-for-Terra-77f67a879b124a72a984a236b0428620) 500k LUNA to Flipside to run a validator node on the Terra network. They yield generated from this validator node subsidises the bounties paid for the creation of data analytics by the community.

## HiPPos and Problem Statements

From "[My product management toolkit (4) — Problem statements](https://maa1.medium.com/my-product-management-toolkit-4-problem-statements-27e7ebe8804d)".


_What's a problem statement?_

A problem statement is a **formula** used to focus on the key **problems** to be solved. Importantly, problem statements don't include a **solution**. 

_What's the formula?_ 

1. **Stakeholder** (describe person using empathetic language)
2. `NEEDS A WAY TO` **Need** (this is a verb)
3. `BECAUSE` **Insight** (describe what you’ve learned about the stakeholder and their needs).

Here's an example:

_Richard, who loves to eat biscuits wants to find a way to eat at 5 biscuits a day without gaining weight as he’s currently struggling to keep his weight under control._

_What's a HiPPo?_
> HiPPo stands for the “highest paid person’s opinion”, who based on their experience or status knows exactly what needs to happen and why. --- [MAA1](https://maa1.medium.com/my-product-management-toolkit-4-problem-statements-27e7ebe8804d)

> Before you start thinking about solutions, please spend a good amount of time understanding the problem that you’re looking to solve. Please, please don’t be intimidated by ‘HiPPo stakeholders’ who already know the solution and tell you to ‘just to make things happen.’ --- [MAA1](https://maa1.medium.com/my-product-management-toolkit-4-problem-statements-27e7ebe8804d)
