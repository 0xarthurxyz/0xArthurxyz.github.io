## Chris Dixon's Idea Maze

A colleague kindly shared this article with me: ["The idea maze" by Chris Dixon [2013]](https://cdixon.org/2013/08/04/the-idea-maze/)  

**TLDR**:

* Most ideas have been tried in the past.
* Spend some time learning from the past to save you time focusing on 'provably' wrong priorities/making similar mistakes.

1. Learn from history (especially for failures)
2. Build by analogy (to similar businesses)
3. Consider startup theories (for best practices)
4. Learn from direct experience (put yourself into interesting idea mazes and give yourself time to figure it out)

## The Two Games You Can Play at a Startup

ðŸ‘‡ Thread in plain text:

Short thread on something I wish I had understood much better 10 years ago:

If you are ambitious, there are basically two games you can play at a startup. Many people early in their careers (especially those from big tech, consulting, finance) play the wrong game, and lose both.

* Game 1: Optimize for company outcome. Spend all of your time finding and fixing the highest leverage problems you can

* Game 2: Optimize for career outcome. Seek external signals like title, scope, and team size. Make sure you're "learning the right things"

The more your personal outcome and the company outcome are synonymous, the more obvious it is that Game 1 is the right choice. Founders and people at startups with <10 people almost always play Game 1. At the largest companies, it's more natural (and probably actually in your best interest) to play Game 2. This is close to the definition of why it is so awful to work at very large companies. 

But at most startups, even those with hundreds or thousands of people, it's almost always the right choice to play Game 1. Doing so will result in a better outcome for the company, but also a better outcome your career, for two reasons:

1. Startups are an iterated game. Earning a reputation for playing Game 1 **opens doors**

2. It's actually very hard to know what is good for your career. Being pulled by the intersection of what the company needs and what you're good at works **better than any "20 year career plan"**

As a result, the right move is to focus on putting yourself in the **best companies** with the **best teams** you can, and then playing **Game 1**.

## Great Interview with @mevintern

From [#29: Interview with a Searcher â€“ with MEV Senpai and Hasu + transcript](https://uncommoncore.co/29-interview-with-a-searcher-with-mev-senpai-and-hasu/)

> I sat down with MEV Senpai, one of the top searchers in Ethereum. He gave us the unique inside perspective of someone who finds and captures MEV himself. The result was a long & intense convo, one of the best Iâ€™ve had in a while.

Here's a list of topics covered:

* The **structure** and **actors** of the MEV game
* What is searching, how can you learn it, what **edges** exist
* Intro to **private relays** and **transaction bundles**
* The role of **Flashbots** in DEX trading
* short-term **reorgs** in Ethereum

*What's MEV?*
> Miner extractable value (MEV) is a measure of the profit a miner can make through their ability to arbitrarily include, exclude, or re-order transactions within the blocks they produce. --- [CoinMarketCap](https://coinmarketcap.com/alexandria/glossary/miner-extractable-value-mev)

For context, MEV is one of many arbitrage opportunities on blockchains. Here is an example of what might be the biggest on-chain arbitrage of all time.
