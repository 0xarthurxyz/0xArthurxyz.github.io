ðŸ’¬ This is a standing invitation: if you want to talk verifiable computing and zero-knowledge
cryptography, I want to talk to you.

You can reach me at [hello@arthurgousset.com](mailto:email@arthurgousset.com). I read every message
I get, and I try to reply to most of them.

- **I like getting messages.** I have never, not even once, regretted getting a message from a
  startup, engineer, student, or person interested in our industry. There is absolutely nothing you
  can do in my inbox which will cause me to think poorly of you as a person or make fun of you to my
  friends. The worst thing that has ever happened from someone sending me a message is me being a
  bit busy that day and not replying. Feel free to send me messages.
- **I like reading things.** If you write something worth reading, tell me. Again, the worst thing
  that has ever happened as a result of that is that I just donâ€™t read it. All that cost you was a
  two-line message.
- **I like making software.** This is doubly true of software which is relevant to my interests. A
  non-exclusive list of those would include verifiable computing, applied cryptography, and software
  for underserved niches. If you write software that you think I would be interested in, feel free
  to send me a message. (n.b. Invites/license keys are nice, specific questions you have about the
  product are even better.)
- **I like meeting people at conferences.** If I am at a conference as a guest or speaker, my
  explicit goal for being there is to talk to you. Come up and introduce yourself :)
- **I like meeting people when Iâ€™m on work trips.** I periodically visit countries around the world
  on work. If Iâ€™m in town on work, feel free to invite me to say hello, get coffee, etc.
